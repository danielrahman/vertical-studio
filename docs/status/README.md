# Status Folder

This folder is the persistent cross-session context for this repository.

## Files
1. `PROJECT_STATE.md` - current implementation state snapshot.
2. `BACKLOG.md` - actionable task list with statuses.
3. `SESSION_LOG.md` - chronological handoff log across sessions.

## Update Rules
1. Update these files whenever implementation state changes.
2. Keep entries short, factual, and diff-oriented.
3. Use only statuses: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`.
