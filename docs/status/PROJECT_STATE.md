## Current Goal

Move from decision-complete documentation to incremental v3 implementation, preserving v2 compatibility during transition.

## Done

1. v3 plan documentation revised to vertical-intelligence-first architecture.
2. Plan pack expanded with new ADRs and domain specs:
  1. `docs/plan/adr-005-evidence-confidence-policy.md`
  2. `docs/plan/adr-006-component-contracts-and-bounded-copy.md`
  3. `docs/plan/adr-007-vertical-intelligence-pattern-policy.md`
  4. `docs/plan/50-component-contracts.md`
  5. `docs/plan/60-copy-system.md`
  6. `docs/plan/70-vertical-research-standard.md`
3. Existing plan docs (`00/10/20/30/40`) aligned to locked decisions.
4. Quality docs updated with COPY/LAYOUT/MEDIA/LEGAL P0 families and KPI-ready release report sections.
5. Security docs updated with required JSON findings contract and explicit release gate schema.
6. Persistent cross-session tracking maintained in `docs/status/*`.
7. Monorepo workspace scaffold added (`apps/*`, `packages/*`) with legacy runtime compatibility bridges and root npm workspaces.
8. Workspace TypeScript toolchain baseline added:
  1. shared `tsconfig` (`tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.json`)
  2. ESLint baseline (`.eslintrc.cjs`)
  3. Prettier baseline (`.prettierrc.json`)
  4. Vitest baseline (`vitest.config.ts`, `tests/vitest/*`)
  5. root scripts (`typecheck`, `lint`, `format:check`, `test:vitest`)
9. `packages/schema` canonical contracts implemented (TypeScript + Zod) for extraction evidence, vertical standards, component contracts, copy lifecycle, review transition requests, manual overrides, and secret-ref metadata.
10. Additive v3 API route families registered under `/api/v1/*` with deterministic skeleton handlers for tenant, vertical research, component contracts, compose/copy, overrides, review transitions, publish/rollback, cms webhook, and secret refs.
11. Review transition guard service implemented with explicit reason-code outcomes for invalid transitions (`transition_not_allowed`, `state_mismatch`, `event_mismatch`, `reason_required`).
12. Compose/copy skeleton implemented with deterministic proposal IDs plus bounded slot definitions and candidate generation policy (high-impact `A/B/C`, non-high-impact `SINGLE`).

CMS webhook unknown-payload received-allowed-field-count metadata hardening implemented (`VS3-IMP-227`): `POST /api/v1/cms/webhooks/publish` unknown top-level payload validation errors now include deterministic `receivedAllowedTopLevelFieldCount` metadata (count of allowed fields present in sorted `receivedTopLevelFields`) alongside deterministic unknown/received/allowed field metadata, with API/WS-C contract coverage and plan text alignment.
235. CMS webhook unknown-payload received-allowed-field-list metadata hardening implemented (`VS3-IMP-228`): `POST /api/v1/cms/webhooks/publish` unknown top-level payload validation errors now include deterministic sorted `receivedAllowedTopLevelFields` metadata (allowed fields present in sorted `receivedTopLevelFields`) alongside deterministic unknown/received/allowed field metadata, with API/WS-C contract coverage and plan text alignment.
236. CMS webhook unknown-payload received-allowed-field-index metadata hardening implemented (`VS3-IMP-229`): `POST /api/v1/cms/webhooks/publish` unknown top-level payload validation errors now include deterministic sorted `receivedAllowedTopLevelFieldIndexes` metadata (indexes into sorted `allowedTopLevelFields`) alongside deterministic unknown/received/allowed field metadata, with API/WS-C contract coverage and plan text alignment.
237. Published runtime snapshot selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-230`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now prefers selected copy candidate text for mapped runtime slots (`hero.h1`,`hero.subhead`,`contact.primary_cta_label`) with deterministic locale-priority fallback and API/WS-E contract coverage.
238. Hero primary CTA selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-231`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now also prefers selected `hero.primary_cta_label` candidate text for `hero.slots.primaryCtaLabel`, with deterministic fallback behavior and API/WS-E contract coverage.
239. Value-props intro selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-232`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now prefers selected `value_props.intro` candidate text for `value_props.slots.intro`, with deterministic fallback behavior and API/WS-E contract coverage.
240. About intro selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-233`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now prefers selected `about.intro` candidate text for `about.slots.intro`, with deterministic fallback behavior and API/WS-E contract coverage.
241. Process step-title selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-234`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now prefers selected `process.step_1_title` candidate text for `process.slots.step1Title`, with deterministic fallback behavior and API/WS-E contract coverage.
242. FAQ question selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-235`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now prefers selected `faq.q1` candidate text for `faq.slots.question1`, with deterministic fallback behavior and API/WS-E contract coverage.
243. FAQ answer selected-copy mapping implemented (`VS3-IMP-236`): publish-time immutable snapshot generation now prefers selected `faq.a1` candidate text for `faq.slots.answer1`, with deterministic fallback behavior and API/WS-E contract coverage.
244. Public runtime client compatibility fallback implemented (`VS3-IMP-238`): `apps/public-web` runtime rendering now prefers immutable snapshot fetch by `storageKey` and falls back to compatibility fetch by `siteId+versionId` when resolve payload omits `storageKey`, with runtime-client tests and runtime contract text aligned.
245. WS-E runtime compatibility snapshot success-path coverage implemented (`VS3-IMP-239`): API and docs-acceptance suites now assert that compatibility `GET /api/v1/public/runtime/snapshot?siteId=&versionId=` returns immutable payload fully equivalent to storage-key snapshot fetch.
246. Runtime client incomplete-resolve deterministic error handling implemented (`VS3-IMP-240`): `renderSiteFromRuntime` now throws `runtime_resolve_incomplete` when resolve payload lacks both `storageKey` and complete `siteId+versionId`, preventing ambiguous fallback assertion failures and adding explicit unit coverage.
247. Runtime fallback contract text lock implemented in docs acceptance (`VS3-IMP-241`): docs completion assertions now enforce API contract wording for storage-key-first runtime fetch with compatibility `siteId+versionId` fallback.
248. Runtime compatibility snapshot not-found coverage implemented (`VS3-IMP-242`): API and WS-E acceptance suites now assert compatibility `GET /api/v1/public/runtime/snapshot` returns `404 runtime_version_not_found` for unknown `siteId/versionId` combinations.
249. Runtime-client compatibility error-propagation coverage implemented (`VS3-IMP-243`): public-web runtime client tests now assert compatibility fallback (`siteId+versionId`) surfaces API error metadata (`code`, `statusCode`, `details`) unchanged when snapshot fetch fails.
250. Runtime-client resolve-payload trim normalization coverage implemented (`VS3-IMP-244`): public-web runtime client tests now assert resolve payload whitespace is trimmed for storage-key snapshot fetches and fallback `siteId+versionId` compatibility fetch parameters.

## In Progress

1. No active implementation item is currently in progress.
2. Hardening backlog remains paused by request; continue in non-hardening categories.

## Next

1. Select and start the next smallest non-hardening implementation slice after runtime-client trim normalization coverage (candidate: extend public-web runtime client coverage for by-storage-key error propagation through `renderSiteFromRuntime` path).

## Known Constraints

1. Keep compatibility with existing generation/extraction endpoints.
2. Composition remains deterministic with exactly three curated variants.
3. Competitor data is pattern-level only (`IA + CTA + trust + tone`).
4. Publish must block on quality `P0` and unresolved security `critical/high`.
5. Corpus remains optional and non-blocking in v1.
